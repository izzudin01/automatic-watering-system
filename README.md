## Features:
### *Cost-Effective Design*
- Utilizes fundamental electronic components, making it affordable and accessible for small-scale gardeners.
- Provides a budget-friendly alternative to expensive commercial watering systems, ensuring broader accessibility.

### *Precision Control*
- Implements Operational Amplifiers (Op-Amps) as comparators to monitor soil moisture levels accurately.
- Uses Field Effect Transistors (FETs) as switches to activate the watering system precisely when needed, ensuring optimal water usage and plant health.

### *Protection and Reliability*
- Incorporates Zener diodes to safeguard the circuit from overvoltage, enhancing the durability and safety of the system.
- Employs voltage regulators to maintain a consistent power supply to all components, ensuring stable and reliable operation of the watering system.
